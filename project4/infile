Instead of using semaphores to synchronize concurrent activities,
This assignment offers an opportunity for you to use the mutex locks
and condition variables to coordinate the producer and the consumer
activities in the context of the file copying application.
In contrast to the semaphore-based solution where the order
of two semaphore wait operations is of pivotal importance to avoid
potential deadlocks, the mutex-lock-condition-variable approach allows
a thread to suspend on a particular condition and release the mutex
lock at the same time via the pthread_cond_wait operation, therefore
avoiding potential deadlocks. This exercise helps reinforce the point
that there are different synchronization approaches to a given problem.
