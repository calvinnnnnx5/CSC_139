1.First-Come First Serve Schedualing
Avergae Wait Time - (15 + 27 + 36 + 42 + 45)/6 = 27.5
Average Normalized Turnaround Time - (1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 13 + 41)/6 = 11

Average Wait Time - (1 + 4 + 10 + 19 + 31)/6 = 10.8
Average Normalized Turnaround Time - (1+1+1+1+2+2)/6 = 1.3

2. Round Robin
Number of context switching for time quantum 1 (RR1) - 43
Number of context switching for time quantum 4 (RR4) - 13

3. Shortest-Job-First (SPN) and Shortest-Remaining-Time-First (SRT)
Average turnaround time by SPN - 23.3
Average turnaround time by SRT - 18.5

4. RMS
Find a workload of 3 periodic tasks that is not schedulable by RMS. Indicate their respective
service times and periods - service times are 4 2 4 and period is 10 15 10
Indicate the mistake in the presentation of the animation for the default example of three periodic
tasks - ?

5. FIFO Page Replacement Algorithm
FIFO Page Replacement Algorithm. For the reference string of “1 2 3 4 1 2 5 1 2 3 4 5”, verify that
Belady’s anomaly for 3-frame and 4-frame cases. Submit the number of page faults for 3-frame and
4-frame allocations - 9 pages faults and 10 page faults

6.LRU and MFU Page Replacement Algorithms. Compare the two with regard to the reference string
of “7 0 1 2 0 3 0 4 2 3 0 3 2 1 2 0 1 7 0 1” and submit the number of page of faults generated by the
two for 4-frame and 5-frame allocations - LRU with 4 frame size gives 8 page faults, LRU with 5 frame
size gives 7 page faults, MFU with 4 frame size gives 10 page faults, MFU with 5 frame size gives 9
page faults

7. Clock Page Replacement Algorithm. Find out which pages will be replaced by Clock replacement
for bringing in pages 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16, respectively. Submit 5 pairs of “Page xx replaced by yy”.
-  17 replaced by 12, 1 replaced by 13, 2 replaced by 14, 7 replaced by 15, 4 replaced by 16

8. Banker’s Algorithm. Produce an unsafe state by changing the content of Claim (Maximum Needs) -
P1 is 4,2,1 and P2 is 6,1,3 and P3 is 2,2,6 and P4 is 8,2,4
