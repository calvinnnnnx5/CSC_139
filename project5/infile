WITH THE MMAP CALL, A DISK FILE GETS LOADED INTO MEMORY THROUGH DEMAND
PAGING, I.E., A PAGE-SIZED PORTION OF THE FILE IS INITIALLY READ INTO
MEMORY THROUGH A PAGE FAULT. SUBSEQUENT READS AND WRITES TO THAT PORTION
OF THE FILE ARE HANDLED AS ROUTINE MEMORY ACCESSES. THIS IMPROVES FILE
PROCESSING PERFORMANCE. IN THIS ASSIGNMENT, THE PARENT PROCESS MEMORY MAPS
THIS DISK FILE FIRST, AND THEN CREATES TWO CHILD PROCESSES THAT EACH MAKE
SOME CHANGES TO THIS FILE. WHEN BOTH CHILD PROCESSES ARE DONE, CHANGES
MADE IN MEMORY ARE SYNCH'ED TO THE DISK FILE.
